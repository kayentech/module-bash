# Sixth Bash Exercise

Write a so-called mapping function that applies a command or a function name
to all arguments provided in turn.

---

You can copy the code to a fresh file and add the
following lines in order to understand **map** more closely:

`map echo "some" "variables on the" "commandline"` 

`cd ~/bash-course #replace by dir where you downloaded the git into` 

`map head "resources/testfile" "resources/matrices/3.mtx."`
