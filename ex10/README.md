# 10th Bash Exercise

Write a script using inline **awk** code to rebuild the piped version
of the command  **wc -l**, i.e. your script should count the number of lines of all
data provided.

* Your **awk** program will need three rules: One that initialises everything,
one that is run for each line unconditionally and one that runs at the end
dealing with the results.
